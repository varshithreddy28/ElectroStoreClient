## Working:

There are two roles :

1. Client:

In this a client can view the products and add them to cart.But for purchasing the products client must be logged in.
And also a client can provide the review and rating for the product.

2. Admin:

The admin can add, edit and delete the products.
Admin can also set the products to delivered.
Admin has all the controls over the Reviews posted by the clients.
